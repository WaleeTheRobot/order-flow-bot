## Setting Up Your Environment

To contribute to this project, you will need:

- [NinjaTrader 8](https://ninjatrader.com/) (you'll need the lifetime license or the OrderFlow+ package to work with the volumetric data)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (the Community version works great)
- C#6 and NinjaScript knowledge

Ensure that NinjaTrader's AddOns directory is configured correctly to include `OrderFlowBot`.

### Directory Structure

The project structure is unconventional. The `OrderFlowBot` code resides in the following directory: `/AddOns/OrderFlowBot`

## Workflow for Contributing

1. **Fork the repository.**

   - Start by creating your own fork of the project.

2. **Clone your fork locally.**

   - Move the OrderFlowBot directory into your NinjaTrader AddOns directory normally located at: `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\NinjaTrader 8\bin\Custom\AddOns`.

3. Open the project in Visual Studio.

   - Open the solution in Visual Studio.
   - Make your changes in the OrderFlowBot directory.
   - Make sure NinjaTrader Editor is open. Saving the files in Visual Studio will trigger NinjaTrader to compile the changes.

4. **Auto-format your code.**

   - Before submitting your changes, ensure that your code is formatted using Visual Studioâ€™s built-in auto-formatting tools:
   - Right-click the file in the Solution Explorer.
   - Select Format Document or use the shortcut (Ctrl + K, Ctrl + D).
   - This can also be set to auto-format on save.

5. **Test your changes in NinjaTrader.**

   - Ensure your changes work correctly by running NinjaTrader with your updated AddOn.

6. **Remove and replace the directory in NinjaTrader.**
   - After formatting, delete the existing OrderFlowBot directory in the AddOns directory for the repository. This will help show the recent changes in the source control.
   - Copy your updated directory to the AddOns directory.

## Code Formatting

- Use Visual Studio's auto-format feature before committing.
- Ensure there are no errors in the code. NinjaTrader will not compile if there are errors.

## Tests

- This project uses GitHub Actions for tests.
- Install Docker Desktop.
- Install `act` locally to write and run tests. You can do it with Chocolatey on Windows with `choco install act-cli`.
- Use `act` to build and run the tests. Use `act -j test` to just run the tests.

## Submitting Changes

1. Commit your changes.

   - Make sure your commit messages are clear and descriptive.

2. Push to your fork.

3. Create a Pull Request (PR).

   - Submit a PR to the main or a primary feature branch such as dev or version if it exists with a detailed description of your changes.

4. Respond to any feedback.

   - Be ready to make necessary revisions based on feedback from the maintainers.

## Additional Notes

- This project follows an event-driven architecture. Be mindful of this when making changes or adding new features.
- Try to keep services and components modular.
- Avoid depending on NinjaTrader namespaces for your components so you can create tests. If you need the NinjaTrader namespaces then you can pass in data from them into your components. This will make mocking easier.
- Contributions to documentation are also welcome!

Thank you for contributing!
